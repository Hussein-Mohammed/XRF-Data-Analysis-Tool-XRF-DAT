# XRF-Data Analysis Tool (XRF-DAT)

The main goal of the XRF-DAT is to analyse tabular data generated by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy in order to ease and speed up the processing and evaluation of data obtained when analysing written artefacts; in particular their inks, pigments and writing supports.

The main tasks achieved by this software tool are:

Process the generated tabular data according to user-defined settings for manual inspection.
Process multiple measurements per source per folio based on user selection.
Calculate the average, max and min values of multiple measurements from the same folio and source.
Generate a table to be used for scatter plots.
Specify energy ranges to be included and excluded from the spectrum.
Calculate distances between different measurements using euclidean distance measure (L2).
