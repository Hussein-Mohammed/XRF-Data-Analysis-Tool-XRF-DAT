<p>
        This software tool has been developed by <a href="http://uhh.de/hussein-adnan-mohammed"> Dr. Hussein Mohammed</a>
        as a part of sub-project RFA05: <a href="https://www.written-artefacts.uni-hamburg.de/research/field-a/rfa05.html">
            Pattern Recognition in 2D Data from Digitised Images and Advanced Aquisition Techniques
        </a>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        The main goal of this software tool is to analyse tabular data generated by XRF spectrometers within the scope of
        analysing writing, painting, and supports materials of written artefacts. The main tasks achieved by this software tool are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Process the generated tabular data according to user-defined settings for manual inspection
            </li>
            <li>
                Generate a table to be used for scatter plots
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculate distances between different measurements using euclidean distance measure (L2)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-style:normal">What is new in this version?</h3>
    <p>
        This version allows you to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Process multiple measurements per source per folio based on user selection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Calculate the average, max and min values of multiple measurements from the same folio and source.
        </li>
        <li>
            Specify energy ranges to be included and excluded from the spectrum.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

        The analysis in this application has been developed in close collaboration with <a href="https://www.written-artefacts.uni-hamburg.de/people/bosch.html">
            Dr. Sebastian Bosch
        </a> and <a href="https://www.written-artefacts.uni-hamburg.de/people/colini.html">M.A. Claudia Colini</a> from the
        <a href="https://www.written-artefacts.uni-hamburg.de/">CSMC</a> , Hamburg. Furthermore, I would like to thank both of them for testing the
        application and validating the results.
